# Cloudinary Integration Complete

**Date:** October 14, 2025
**Status:** ‚úÖ Backend Integration Complete | üîÑ Frontend Updates Needed

---

## Overview

This document details the Cloudinary cloud storage integration for the PDF Signing Application. Files are now uploaded to and stored in Cloudinary instead of the local filesystem, providing scalable and reliable cloud storage.

---

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Cloudinary SDK Installation ‚úÖ

```bash
npm install cloudinary
```

### 2. Environment Configuration ‚úÖ

Added to [backend/.env](file:///D:/Anonymous/Azaya%20Marketing/PDF-Signing-Project/backend/.env):

```env
# Cloudinary Configuration
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=dazctlr75
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=649165482652494
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=ml3GBxqoWV0HymSK0ANnBVXO3Ew
CLOUDINARY_URL=cloudinary://649165482652494:ml3GBxqoWV0HymSK0ANnBVXO3Ew@dazctlr75
CLOUDINARY_FOLDER=pdf-signing
```

### 3. Cloudinary Configuration Module ‚úÖ

**File:** [backend/config/cloudinary.js](file:///D:/Anonymous/Azaya%20Marketing/PDF-Signing-Project/backend/config/cloudinary.js)

Initializes Cloudinary with credentials and exports configured instance.

### 4. Cloudinary Service Module ‚úÖ

**File:** [backend/services/cloudinaryService.js](file:///D:/Anonymous/Azaya%20Marketing/PDF-Signing-Project/backend/services/cloudinaryService.js)

**Functions:**
- `uploadPDF(filePath, options)` - Upload PDF to Cloudinary
- `downloadPDF(cloudinaryUrl, localPath)` - Download PDF from Cloudinary
- `updatePDF(publicId, localFilePath)` - Replace/update existing PDF
- `deletePDF(publicId)` - Delete PDF from Cloudinary
- `extractPublicId(url)` - Extract public_id from Cloudinary URL
- `getPDFInfo(publicId)` - Get PDF metadata

**Key Features:**
- Automatic folder organization by userId and documentId
- Proper resource_type: 'raw' for PDF files
- Comprehensive error handling
- Automatic file cleanup after operations
- Tags and context metadata for tracking

### 5. Database Schema Update ‚úÖ

**File:** [backend/prisma/schema.prisma](file:///D:/Anonymous/Azaya%20Marketing/PDF-Signing-Project/backend/prisma/schema.prisma:37)

Added `cloudinaryPublicId` field to Document model:

```prisma
model Document {
  id                 String    @id @default(uuid())
  name               String
  originalFileName   String
  fileUrl            String
  cloudinaryPublicId String?   // NEW: Cloudinary public_id
  status             Status    @default(PENDING)
  // ... other fields
}
```

**Migration:** `20251014072115_add_cloudinary_public_id`

### 6. Upload Route Updated ‚úÖ

**File:** [backend/routes/documents.js](file:///D:/Anonymous/Azaya%20Marketing/PDF-Signing-Project/backend/routes/documents.js:16)

**Changes:**
1. Upload file to Cloudinary after receiving from Multer
2. Store Cloudinary URL and public_id in database
3. Delete local temporary file after successful upload
4. Handle errors with proper cleanup

**Workflow:**
```
User uploads PDF
  ‚Üí Multer saves to temp location
  ‚Üí Upload to Cloudinary
  ‚Üí Save URL + public_id to database
  ‚Üí Delete local temp file
  ‚Üí Return document info
```

### 7. Sign Route Updated ‚úÖ

**File:** [backend/routes/documents.js](file:///D:/Anonymous/Azaya%20Marketing/PDF-Signing-Project/backend/routes/documents.js:220)

**Changes:**
1. Download PDF from Cloudinary to temp location
2. Embed signature using pdf-lib (existing functionality)
3. Upload signed PDF back to Cloudinary (replaces original)
4. Update database with new URL
5. Delete temp file

**Workflow:**
```
Signer submits signature
  ‚Üí Download PDF from Cloudinary
  ‚Üí Embed signature with pdf-lib
  ‚Üí Upload signed PDF to Cloudinary
  ‚Üí Update database
  ‚Üí Delete local temp file
  ‚Üí Return signed document
```

### 8. PDF Viewer Component Created ‚úÖ

**File:** [frontend/app/components/PDFViewer.tsx](file:///D:/Anonymous/Azaya%20Marketing/PDF-Signing-Project/frontend/app/components/PDFViewer.tsx)

A React component for displaying PDFs in an iframe with:
- Loading state with spinner
- Error handling with retry option
- Full-view link
- Responsive design

---

## How It Works

### File Organization in Cloudinary

```
cloudinary://dazctlr75/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ pdf-signing/                    # Base folder
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {userId}/                   # User's folder
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {documentId}_{timestamp}.pdf  # Document file
```

**Example:**
```
pdf-signing/user-123/doc_1697123456789_1697123456790.pdf
```

### Upload Flow

1. **Frontend ‚Üí Backend**
   - User selects PDF file in upload form
   - Remix sends multipart/form-data to `/api/documents/upload`

2. **Backend Processing**
   - Multer middleware saves file temporarily to `uploads/`
   - Cloudinary service uploads file to cloud storage
   - Database record created with Cloudinary URL
   - Local temp file deleted

3. **Result**
   - PDF stored in Cloudinary at: `https://res.cloudinary.com/dazctlr75/raw/upload/v{version}/pdf-signing/{userId}/{docId}.pdf`
   - Database contains: `fileUrl` (Cloudinary URL) and `cloudinaryPublicId`

### Signing Flow

1. **Download for Processing**
   - When signer submits signature
   - Backend downloads PDF from Cloudinary to temp location
   - Signature embedded using pdf-lib

2. **Upload Signed Version**
   - Signed PDF uploaded back to Cloudinary
   - Uses same `public_id` with `overwrite: true`
   - Cloudinary creates new version automatically
   - URL updated with new version number

3. **Cleanup**
   - Temp file deleted from local filesystem
   - Only Cloudinary version persists

**Current:** Shows placeholder icon
**Needed:**
- Fetch document from `/api/documents/:id`
- Use PDFViewer component with Cloudinary URL
- Connect signature submission to API

#### 4. Review Route - Show Signed PDF

**File:** [uploader.review.$id.tsx](file:///D:/Anonymous/Azaya%20Marketing/PDF-Signing-Project/frontend/app/routes/uploader.review.$id.tsx)

## Testing the Integration

### 1. Start Backend Server

```bash
cd backend
npm start
```

Expected output:
```
‚úÖ Cloudinary configured: { cloud_name: 'dazctlr75', api_key: '***2494' }
‚úÖ Server running on: http://localhost:5000
```

### 2. Test Upload via API

```bash
# Login first
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"uploader@example.com","password":"password123","role":"UPLOADER"}'

# Save the token from response

# Upload PDF
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/documents/upload \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -F "file=@test.pdf" \
  -F "name=Test Document" \
  -F "assignedTo=signer@example.com"
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "document": {
    "id": "...",
    "name": "Test Document",
    "fileUrl": "https://res.cloudinary.com/dazctlr75/raw/upload/v.../pdf-signing/...",
    "cloudinaryPublicId": "pdf-signing/.../...",
    "status": "PENDING"
  }
}
```

### 3. Verify in Cloudinary Dashboard

1. Go to: https://cloudinary.com/console
2. Login with your credentials
3. Navigate to Media Library
4. Look for `pdf-signing` folder
5. You should see uploaded PDFs

### 4. Test Frontend Upload

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000
2. Login as uploader@example.com / password123
3. Go to Upload page
4. Select a PDF file
5. Assign to signer@example.com
6. Click "Upload & Assign"
7. Check backend console for Cloudinary upload logs
8. Check Cloudinary dashboard for the file

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Cloudinary upload failed"

**Check:**
1. Environment variables are set correctly in `.env`
2. API key and secret are valid
3. Cloud name is correct (`dazctlr75`)
4. Network connection is working

**Solution:**
```bash
# Verify credentials
node -e "console.log(require('./config/cloudinary').config())"
```

### Issue: "PDF not displaying in frontend"

**Check:**
1. Cloudinary URL is accessible (open in browser)
2. CORS is enabled on backend
3. PDFViewer component is imported
4. Document fileUrl is valid

**Solution:**
- Ensure URL starts with `https://res.cloudinary.com/`
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify iframe can load external URLs

### Issue: "File too large"

**Check:**
1. File size limit in Multer (currently 10MB)
2. Cloudinary free tier limits

**Solution:**
```javascript
// In backend/middleware/upload.js
const upload = multer({
  limits: { fileSize: 10 * 1024 * 1024 } // 10MB
});
```
